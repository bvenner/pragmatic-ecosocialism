This article was recommended by Aaran Gare on Research Gate.

I chose to read this article this evening because I'm interested in how the transcendental semiotics of Apel can be linked with the speculative naturalism of Gare.  One potential approach is the 'weak naturalism' of Habermas, but I'm not sure that Apel subscribes to this approach.

On Thellefsen's ResearchGate page he has a new article entitled 'Information as Signs' that might be worth reading and a project called 'Digital Semiotics'.

The article opens with a discussion of the relationship between semiotics and evolutionary metaphysics.  The author states that his opinion is that these concepts cannot be understood without the other.  Apel argues that transcendental semiotics is primary and that metaphysics depends upon it, which was also Peirce's postion (needs cites).

The author proposes a nature, man, culture trichotomy that is close to my ecology, society, semiotics understanding, which I got from Murphy.  Nature is potentiality, man actuality and culture "necessity".  Also brings to mind Mirowski's nature-society "adjunction", whose name I'm forgetting.  Murphy's division is natural, conventional and stipulated, taken from Poinsot.
